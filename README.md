As a driven and curious computer engineering student, I have a passion for learning and leveraging emerging technologies to solve complex problems. During my time as an undergraduate research assistant and as a coop in KOHLER and TESLA, I gained valuable experience in circuit design and validation, electronics as well as exposure to the exciting fields of automotive engineering and machine learning. My programming skills in PLC, Python and C++ have enabled me to dive into complex projects with ease and deliver high-quality results
